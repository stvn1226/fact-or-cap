# fact-or-cap
A full-stack web application adapted from an older console app game, with two game modes: FACT OR CAP, where the player is given a 'fact' and they have to guess whether it is true or false, and TWO FACTS AND A CAP, where the player is given three 'facts' and they have to find the fake fact.
